```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a package of practical things I use every day. Thus, it is not really community oriented.

`edouaRd` can be installed from Github :

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edouardschuppert/edouaRd")
```

# povertext

`povertext` deplete your text, it deletes any accents or umlaut.

```{r}
require(edouaRd, quietly = TRUE)

your_string <- c("Père Noël", "Où êtes-vous ?")

povertext(your_string)

```

# datetimes_fr

`datetimes_fr` turn your dates into a french format. Please note that this is NOT a useful format to work with R. This function can only be used with a purpose of report, in order to have a very understandable format.

```{r}
require(edouaRd, quietly = TRUE)

Sys.time()

datetimes_fr(Sys.time())

```
